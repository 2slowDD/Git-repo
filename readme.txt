Per-page JavaScript & CSS asset management. Surgically dequeue scripts and styles on any page using exact, wildcard, or regex URL rules.

== Description ==

Code Unloader gives site administrators surgical control over which JavaScript and CSS files are loaded on each individual page or post.

**Key Features:**

* Disable any registered JS or CSS file on any page or post
* Exact URL, wildcard pattern (/shop/*), and full regex matching
* Rules survive cache flushes and plugin reactivations
* Assets grouped by plugin, theme, or WordPress Core in the panel
* Per-page frontend panel accessible from the Admin Toolbar
* Access panel on any page via `?wpcu` URL parameter
* Global admin screen listing all rules across the site
* One-click kill switch to instantly restore all assets sitewide
* Bypass all rules for a single request via `?nowpcu` URL parameter
* Conditional rules (logged-in users, WooCommerce pages, shortcodes, post types)
* Device-type rules (desktop-only or mobile-only)
* Inline script/style blocking for assets without registered handles
* Inline block detection — see every inline `<script>` and `<style>` on the page
* Rule groups for managing sets of rules as a unit
* Full audit log of all changes
* JSON import/export
* Zero performance overhead on pages with no matching rules

**Compatible with:** WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, LiteSpeed Cache, WP Super Cache, WooCommerce, Elementor, Divi, WP Bakery, basically everything WP related.

**Requirements:** PHP 8.0 or higher is required. The plugin uses modern PHP features (union types, match expressions, named functions) that are not available in PHP 7.x.

**Note:** It's recommended to test changes on a staging environment before applying them to a live site. Unloading the wrong assets can break your site's appearance or functionality.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to `/wp-content/plugins/code-unloader`
2. Activate the plugin through the **Plugins** screen in WordPress
3. Visit any page while logged in as an admin and click **⚡ Assets** in the Admin Toolbar
4. Toggle off any asset — a rule creation dialog will appear

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What PHP version do I need? =
PHP 8.0 or higher. The plugin will not activate on PHP 7.x.

= Will my rules survive a cache flush? =
Yes. Rules are stored in a custom database table and are not affected by caching plugin cache clears.

= What is the kill switch? =
The kill switch is a one-click emergency recovery button in **Settings > Code Unloader > Settings**. When active, all rules are bypassed and every asset loads normally. Your rules are not deleted — they resume when you deactivate the kill switch.

= What does the ?wpcu parameter do? =
Appending `?wpcu` to any frontend URL will automatically open the asset panel for logged-in administrators, even on pages where the Admin Toolbar is hidden. The parameter stays in the URL while the panel is open and is removed when you close it.

= What does the ?nowpcu parameter do? =
Appending `?nowpcu` to any frontend URL disables all Code Unloader rules for that single request — the page loads exactly as if the plugin were not active. This follows the same convention as `?nowprocket` (WP Rocket) and `?ao_noptimize=1` (Autoptimize). Useful for testing, debugging, or performance scanning tools that need to measure the raw unoptimized asset baseline.

= Does it support regex? =
Yes. When creating a rule, choose **Regular Expression** as the match type. Patterns are validated before saving, and a regex warning is shown to help you keep patterns specific.

= What are inline blocks? =
Inline blocks are `<script>` and `<style>` tags that are printed directly into the page HTML rather than being registered through WordPress's enqueue system. The Inline Blocks tab in the panel detects and lists these blocks so you can identify them.

== Changelog ==

* Fixed: Export now includes ALL rules including those in disabled groups (previously get_rules_filtered silently excluded them)
* Fixed: Export strips the runtime-only group_enabled JOIN column so the JSON is clean
* Fixed: Import now restores groups first, builds an old-ID-to-new-ID map, then remaps each rule's group_id before inserting
* Fixed: Import matches existing groups by name to avoid duplicates; rules stay linked to the correct group
* Fixed: Import preserves group enabled/disabled state
* Improved: Import success message now reports rules imported, groups created, and existing groups matched


= 1.2.4 =
* Style: Source header row (light) — gradient from subtle purple to deep red tint
* Style: Source header row (dark) — gradient from #f0f0f0 to deep red tint; chevron now white
* Style: Warning banner — stronger red gradient applied to both themes


= 1.2.3 =
* Style: Toggle track for unloaded (off) assets changed to red (#cc1818) in both light and dark themes
* Improved: Group-disabled assets now show both the blue "Group: X" badge and a red "Disabled (match_type)" badge, consistent with non-grouped disabled assets

* Style: Source group header rows now have a distinct background to visually separate plugins
* Style: Light theme — header row background: #5500cc52 (semi-transparent purple); count/size/action badges: white with dark text

* All new colour pairs verified against WCAG AA contrast ratios


= 1.2.1 =
* Fixed: Disabled-group rules now correctly excluded from panel rule_map at PHP render time (FrontendPanel)
* Fixed: Same (int) cast bug found and fixed in InlineBlocker group_enabled check
* Fixed: REST get_rules endpoint page_url branch now skips disabled-group rules

* Fixed: "N total rules" count and Rules table now exclude suspended (disabled-group) rules
* Fixed: COUNT query in get_rules_filtered now JOINs groups table so the group-enabled filter applies correctly to pagination totals
* Fixed: Panel (GET /assets) now skips disabled-group rules so assets correctly show as Active when their group is disabled


= 1.2.0 =
* Fixed: Disabling a group now correctly stops its rules from being applied — wpdb returns column values as strings, so "0" was truthy and the group-disabled check never fired; fixed with explicit (int) cast


= 1.1.9 =
* Fixed: "N total rules" counter now updates instantly after any delete (single, bulk, stale) — no page reload needed
* Fixed: Disabling a group now immediately stops its rules from being applied on the frontend — root cause was static in-memory rule cache not being cleared when group enabled state changed


= 1.1.8 =
* Fixed: "Assign" / "Save" button stays greyed out after first group assignment — button now always re-enables after any outcome
* Fixed: Group column shows raw ID instead of name when assigning to a newly created group — integer type mismatch corrected
* Improved: Panel now live-syncs rule_map and groups from the REST API on every open — admin changes are reflected without a page reload

= 1.1.7 =
* Improved: Admin layout widened from 1100px to 1200px
* Improved: Rules table now defaults to 10 per page (was 20)
* Added: "Rules per page" screen option (10 / 20 / 50) accessible via Screen Options tab at the top of the admin page


= 1.1.6 =
* Fixed: Group column in Rules table now updates instantly after bulk-assign — no page reload needed


= 1.1.5 =
